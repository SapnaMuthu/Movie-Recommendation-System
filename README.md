Project Title: Movie Recommendation System

Description:

The Movie Recommendation System aims to suggest movies to users based on various factors such as content similarity, popularity, and collaborative filtering. It employs three different recommendation algorithms: Content Based, Popularity Based, and Collaborative Filtering, each offering unique insights into movie recommendations.

Workflow:

Data Collection & Pre-processing: The dataset is obtained from the provided link and pre-processed to handle missing values.

Feature Extraction: Relevant features such as genres, keywords, tagline, cast, and director are combined to create feature vectors using TF-IDF Vectorization.

Obtaining User Input: Users input their favorite movie name.

Cosine Similarity Algorithm: Cosine similarity is calculated between the input movie and other movies in the dataset to identify similar movies.

Close Match Identification: The difflib library is used to find a close match for the movie name provided by the user.

Movie Recommendation: Based on the similarity scores, a list of recommended movies is generated and presented to the user.

Technologies Used:

Python

pandas

difflib

scikit-learn

TfidfVectorizer

cosine_similarity

Outcome:

The Movie Recommendation System provides personalized movie recommendations to users, enhancing their movie-watching experience and facilitating discovery of new content.

Conclusion:

The Movie Recommendation System leverages advanced algorithms to suggest movies tailored to individual user preferences, fostering engagement and satisfaction among users.
